# Zup Challenge

The challenge was to create a Spring Rest API project that receives, validates and stores the email, name, birthday and CPF of an user. The intention of this challenge is to analyze the ability of the programmer in learn in a small amount of time. Another part of the challenge was writing a [text in a blog post format](https://github.com/Erick-Oliveira-ET/Zup-Challenge/blob/master/Spring%20Boot%20ZUP.pdf) to demonstrate the clarity in passing information and explain the thought process.
